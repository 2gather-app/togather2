## Running the app

1. In order to run the app properly you need to use LTS version of Node. It is advised to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) tool to manage your node instances.
2. After that the only thing left to do is to run `yarn` in a root directory to fetch dependencies and then you can run `yarn start`.
